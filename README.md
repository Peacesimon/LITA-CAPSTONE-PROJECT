### Query to retrieve the total sales for each product category----

```SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Product]
```

Query to find the number of sales transactions in each region------
```SQL
SELECT Region, COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfTransactions
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
```

--------query to find the highest-selling product by total sales value--------
```SQL
SELECT Top 1 Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
```

-------query to calculate total revenue per product------
