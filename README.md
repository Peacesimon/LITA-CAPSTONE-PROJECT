```SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Product]
```

###  Sales transactions in each region------
```SQL
SELECT Region, COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfTransactions
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
```

### Highest-selling product by total sales 
```SQL
SELECT Top 1 Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
```
