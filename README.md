## SQL for Database Management and Quering
---
### Total sales per Product category

```SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Product]
```

###  Sales transactions in each region------
```SQL
SELECT Region, COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfTransactions
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
```

### Highest-selling product by total sales 
```SQL
SELECT Top 1 Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
```
##### Expected Result
![top selling](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e35efcd9-9112-488c-91ac-1cf78fe953f1)

### Total revenue per product------
```SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Product
```
##### Expected Result
![total revenue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea18acd6-7d9d-4f07-b666-ec4342497d04)


### monthly sales totals for the current year------
``` SQL
SELECT FORMAT(OrderDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), 1, 1) -- Start of the current year
AND OrderDate < DATEADD(YEAR, 1, DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), 1, 1)) -- Start of the next year
GROUP BY FORMAT(OrderDate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month
```
##### Expected Result
![total sales monthly ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ddd14c7-ac21-4622-8148-a72d37d05e0c)

### Top 5 Customers by Total purchase
```SQL
SELECT TOP 5 [Customer Id], SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalPurchase
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY [Customer Id]
ORDER BY TotalPurchase DESC
```
##### Expected Result
![top 5 customers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4e696a4-8d0b-4c64-a6af-d0b06d93ff8d)

 ### percentage of total sales  by each region-----
```SQL
select Region,
SUM (sales_Revenue) as total_sales,
round ((select sum (sales_Revenue)/ cast((select sum(sales_Revenue)
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$] ) as float) *100), 0) as
percentage_total_sales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Region DESC
```

### products with no sales in the last quarter------
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT Product
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
WHERE Product NOT IN (
SELECT Product
FROM [dbo].[SalesData$]
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -3, GETDATE())
)
```
##### Expected Result
![not made sales](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15d1f4a5-18ad-43b6-8dcd-189b33661139)
